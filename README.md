# claude-skills

A curated library of Claude skills for consulting, advisory, research, and operations teams. Each skill is a structured prompt system that gives Claude a specialized workflow, quality standard, and output format for a specific job.

All skills are **generic and company-agnostic** — configurable for any organization.

## What Is a Skill?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file that Claude reads at the start of a task. It defines:
- When to activate (trigger conditions)
- How to approach the work (workflow steps)
- What to produce (output format and quality standards)
- How to handle edge cases

Skills are not plugins or code. They are structured instructions that make Claude significantly more consistent, thorough, and high-quality on a specific type of task.

## How to Use a Skill

### Option A: Paste into System Prompt
Copy the contents of a `SKILL.md` file into Claude's system prompt (via API or Claude Projects). Claude will follow the skill's workflow for the relevant task type.

### Option B: Reference in Conversation
Paste the `SKILL.md` contents at the start of a conversation:
```
Use the following skill for this task:

[paste SKILL.md contents]

Now: [your task]
```

### Option C: Claude Projects (Recommended)
Upload `SKILL.md` files to a Claude Project's knowledge base. Claude will reference them automatically when the trigger conditions match.

## Skill Structure

Every skill folder contains:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md       # The skill — trigger logic, workflow, quality standards, output format
├── README.md      # Human-readable card — what it does, when to use, example output
└── examples/      # (optional) Sample inputs and outputs
```

---

## Configuration Skills

Some skills require customization before use. These are marked in their `README.md` under **Setup Required**. The `value-opportunity-gateway` and `proposal-deck-builder` skills in particular contain `[Customize: ...]` placeholders that you replace with your organization's specific service pillars, differentiators, and narrative language.
